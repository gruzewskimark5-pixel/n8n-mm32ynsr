## 2025-02-26 - Transparency in Template Deployment
**Learning:** For deployment templates using free tiers, users often miss critical limitations (like database expiry) which leads to a poor UX and potential data loss. Adding clear warnings and post-deployment steps in the README significantly improves the "Day 2" user experience.
**Action:** Always check the provider's free-tier terms and include specific warnings and setup guides in the README.

## 2025-05-15 - Improving Deployment Visibility with Health Checks
**Learning:** For infrastructure-as-code templates, adding a health check endpoint (like n8n's `/healthz`) to the deployment configuration (`render.yaml`) significantly improves the developer UX by providing real-time feedback during the deploy process and enabling zero-downtime updates.
**Action:** Always identify and implement the application's native health check endpoint in the Blueprint configuration and document it in a "Verification" section in the README.

## 2025-05-16 - Contextual Links for External Constraints
**Learning:** For deployment templates that rely on third-party platform constraints (like free-tier limits), providing direct contextual links to the platform's own documentation significantly reduces user anxiety and improves trust by offering an authoritative source for the behavior.
**Action:** When documenting platform-specific limitations (e.g., spin-down or database expiry), include direct links to the relevant sections of the provider's documentation.
